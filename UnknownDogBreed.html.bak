    <h2>Why do you care so much and why should I?</h2>
	  <p>This question has haunted me since adopting her in the summer of 2020. This is Ophelia, my very friendly and gorgeous dog. 
	  I remember seeing her picture on <a href="https://adoptapet.com/">AdoptAPet.com</a> and thinking, "I 
	  wonder what breed she is. Better remember to ask when I visit her."
	  </p> 
	  <p><strong>Spoiler Alert:</strong> I forgot to ask.</p>
	  <p>Now, you may already have an answer but that's not the point. This is obviously an excuse for me to 
	  show pictures of my dog and other dogs that are not as cute as her but look like her. So the following 
	  are potentially what breed my dog is. I will also rate the dog used in the sample photo by how cute they 
	  are compared to Ophelia.
