  <h1>What Breed is My Dog?</h1>

    <h2>Why do you care so much and why should I?</h2>
	  <p>This question has haunted me since adopting her in the summer of 2020. This is Ophelia, my very friendly and gorgeous dog. 
	  I remember seeing her picture on <a href="https://adoptapet.com/">AdoptAPet.com</a> and thinking, "I 
	  wonder what breed she is. Better remember to ask when I visit her."
	  </p> 
	  <p><strong>Spoiler Alert:</strong> I forgot to ask.</p>
	  <p>Now, you may already have an answer but that's not the point. This is obviously an excuse for me to 
	  show pictures of my dog and other dogs that are not as cute as her but look like her. So the following 
	  are potentially what breed my dog is. I will also rate the dog used in the sample photo by how cute they 
	  are compared to Ophelia.

	<h2>Norwegian Elkhound?</h2>

	  <p>Off to a pretty weak start. I tried this app that guesses your dog's breed and it gave a 20% chance 
	  that she was part Norwegian Elkhound. Makes kinda sense. The body shape is about the same, including 
	  the tail. I only express doubt in its fur. Would not mind having this dog though.
	  </p>
	  <p><strong>Rating: 11/10</strong> Would enjoy an elkhound to bring me elk and still looks like it has 
	  nice fur coat.

	<h2>Pomeranian?</h2>

	  <p> I know this seems absurd, but hear me out. This theory comes from the fact that I had this video sent 
	  to me by a relative. If you follow the link to the website, this person's video is tagged #pomeranion 
	  like probably 5 times. I actually spoke to the person by commenting on their video because you cannot 
	  deny the resemblance. They confirmed that their dog is a pomeranion mix and they saw some videos of mine
	  and theorize that my Ophelia must also be. That is about as much information as I needed to believe it at 
	  least a little.

	  <p><strong>Rating: 13/10</strong> Too small for me but undoubtedly adorable. Would stuff one in my coat for
	  extra warmth. Also, increases value of my dog I think. Not that I would sell her or anything...
