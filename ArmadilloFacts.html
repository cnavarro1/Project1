    <h2>What the heck is that armored shrew thing?</h2>

	<h2>Fun Fact #1: The name "Armadillo" translates from Spanish for "Little Armored One"</h2>
	  <img src="ArmadilloArt.jpg" alt="Mexican Armadillo Sculpture" width="300" height="200">
	  <p>This is one of those times when you learn what something means and realizes that some times people 
	  who name things can be lazy or uncreative. However, this makes sense since Armadillos are native to 
	  parts of Central and South America, where Spanish is mainly spoken. 
	  </p>
	  <p>Actually, my experiences with Armadillos consists mostly of seeing them as roadkill lke every 500 feet 
	  while driving around in Mexico. That was probably the inspiration for the pose the armadillo sculpture
	  seen above. I mean, have you seen Rango? It's literally a joke that they love getting hit by cars or
	  something. Which leads us to our next fact!

	<h2>Fun Fact #2: Nine-banded Armadillos jump three feet into the air as a defense mechanism</h2>

	  <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> I literally laughed so hard when I read this that my roomate thought
	  I was being murdered in my room from the way I was screaming and then crying. With laughter, of course.
	  </p>
	  <p>After learning this, it makes so much more sense that I see so many just squashed on the side of the
	  road. They really see a car coming and think, "If I jump, I won't die." If they literally did the 
	  opposite of that, they would be safe. Why do people talk about lemmings when armadillos are constantly 
	  either trying to kill themselves or commit insurance fraud.
